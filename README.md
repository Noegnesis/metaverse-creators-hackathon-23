# Metaverse Creators Hackathon 2nd Place Project: Mindscape VR

Mindscape VR is virtual reality therapy, which is an innovative approach to the realm of therapy, where by using immersive technology, we can increase the effectiveness of how we treat real-life issues such as mental health disorders and other psychological conditions. 

## About the App

One of the main advantages of VR therapy is that it can be more accessible and convenient than traditional therapy, as it can be done from the comfort of one's own home. In addition, it provides a safe and controlled environment for individuals to confront their fears and anxieties.

In our app, we utilized **OpenAI's ChatGPT** to take on the role of a professional therapist to provide meaningful insight into the user's situation and alleviate any stress someone may be going through. This mixed with a grounding scenery and various tunes allows for the perfect meditative therapeutic session.

## Playing the Game

To play the game, you must have an OpenAI key. To do so, follow the ReadMe of the ChatGPT Unity Package: https://github.com/srcnalt/OpenAI-Unity.

## Future Plans

In the future, we hope to have a server-side API running so that the individual does not need an API key to play the game. We also want to include customizability for scenery and voice by allowing the user to choose various options in a diegetic UI and possibly a scene editor to make their own scenes. Finally, we also plan on making a dynamic environmentâ€”one that adapts to the user's tone of speech to fit the mood.
